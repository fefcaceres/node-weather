# node-weather
A simple weather app that allows a user to type in a city and get the current weather for that city. Defaults to Atlanta if no city typed.

## Things I learned in the process:
- Building an app using Node.js
- Using dotenv package to store environmental variables
- Connecting the Weather API to the app
- Some JavaScript
- Git and GitHub practice
- Using yargs package for interactivity
- Using vim to edit files on command line
